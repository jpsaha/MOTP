  * The Department of Mathematics, IISER Bhopal, would be organizing a series of Mathematics Olympiad Problem Solving Sessions (MOPSS). 
  * The aim is to develop an interest in mathematics among the students by encouraging them to work on problems falling broadly within the scope of the Mathematical Olympiad.
  
  * The plan for MOPSS is spread across the following 9 dates. 
  The sessions will be held during 9:00am to 12:00pm in IISER Bhopal in person classroom meetings.  
    
    <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt" style="color:gray"></i> 3rd, 17th, 31st August, 2024.

    <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt" style="color:gray"></i> 14th, 28th September, 2024.
    
    <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt" style="color:gray"></i> 19th October, 2024.
    
    <i class="fas fa-calendar-alt" style="color:gray"></i> 2nd, 16th, 30th November, 2024.

  * A student will get the maximum benefit out of MOPSS if he/she attends all the above 9 sessions. 

  *  Applications to be accepted <span style="color: royalblue"> **until 07th July, 2024**</span> through the [Google form](https://forms.gle/B9wQteEtGXvCj3AH9) posted at [this link](https://forms.gle/B9wQteEtGXvCj3AH9). 
  * In the Google form, the link to [this problem set]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/MOPSS/PS0B24Aug.pdf) has been provided. While filling in the form, the solutions to these problems (or the details of the progress made) are to be submitted.
  * The students, selected for participation in the session, will be informed by <span style="color: royalblue"> **25th July, 2024**</span>.

## Why math olympiads are a valuable experience for high schoolers

{% details Click here to know more %}
* The post by Evan Chen on [Lessons from math olympiads](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2018/01/05/lessons-from-math-olympiads/) is worth reading.
* In a previous post, titled [Against the “Research vs. Olympiads” Mantra](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2016/08/13/against-the-research-vs-olympiads-mantra/), Evan Chen discussed why math olympiads should not be judged by their relevance to research mathematics. He mentions that in that post, he failed to actually explain why he thinks math olympiads are a valuable experience for high schoolers. In the post [Lessons from math olympiads](https://blog.evanchen.cc/2018/01/05/lessons-from-math-olympiads/), he puts the amends. 
* and the last, but not the least, could be to take a look at the following [vision](https://imof.co/) of the [IMO Foundation](https://imof.co/), which is a charity supporting the International Mathematical Olympiad ([IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/)). 
> It is the aim of the IMO to bring young people together from all over the world to enjoy the challenges of mathematics in a spirit of friendly competition. This provides a stimulus for Mathematics in each of the participating countries as young people strive for selection. Whist clearly it is a competitive event, for most participants, it is the people that they meet and the shared joy of discovery that is what they regard as most worthwhile. It is common that lifelong friendships are forged at IMO events.

## Participation of India in [International Mathematical Olympiads]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/PriorParticipation/) 
<!--<span style="color: green"> **International Mathematical Olympiads**</span>-->
India has been participating in the
* [International Mathematical Olympiad](https://www.imo-official.org/) (IMO) since [1989](https://www.imo-official.org/country_team_r.aspx?code=IND).
* [Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad](https://www.apmo-official.org/) (APMO) since [2015](https://www.apmo-official.org/country_report/IND/all). 
* [European Girls’ Mathematical Olympiad](https://www.egmo.org/) (EGMO) since [2015](https://www.egmo.org/countries/country35/).

If you (the reader!) are aware of these Olympiads, and would like to prepare for them, then you may wish to know about [a few training programs]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/TrainingProg/).

## [Geoff Smith](https://people.bath.ac.uk/masgcs/advice.html) remarked the following in the foreword to the text [Infinity](http://prac.im.pwr.wroc.pl/~kwasnicki/pl/o/infinity.pdf) by [Hojoo Lee](https://cosmogeometer.wordpress.com/problems/), [Tom Lovering](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=15875) (he maintains a [blog](https://tlovering.wordpress.com/)), and [Cosmin Pohoata](https://pohoatza.wordpress.com/).

>The nations which do consistently well at this competition (IMO) must have at least one (and probably at least two) of the following attributes:
> * A large population.
> * A significant proportion of its population in receipt of a good education.
> * A well-organized training infrastructure to support mathematics competitions.
> * A culture which values intellectual achievement.

> Alternatively, you need a cloning facility and a relaxed regulatory framework.
