## [International Mathematical Olympiad](https://www.imo-official.org/) (IMO)
* The International Mathematical Olympiad ([IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/)) is the World Championship Mathematics Competition for High School students. It is held annually in a different country.
* The [IMO Foundation](https://imof.co/) is a charity which supports the IMO. Its [vision](https://imof.co/) is as follows. 
> It is the aim of the IMO to bring young people together from all over the world to enjoy the challenges of mathematics in a spirit of friendly competition. This provides a stimulus for Mathematics in each of the participating countries as young people strive for selection. Whist clearly it is a competitive event, for most participants, it is the people that they meet and the shared joy of discovery that is what they regard as most worthwhile. It is common that lifelong friendships are forged at IMO events.

* The [first IMO](https://www.imo-official.org/year_country_r.aspx?year=1959) was held in Romania in 1959, with seven countries participating.
* It has since been held annually, except in 1980.
* Currently, it has expanded to over [100 countries](https://www.imo-official.org/year_info.aspx?year=2023) across the globe.
* Each country sends a team of up to six students. 
* In the recent past,
  * Japan was the host for [IMO2023](https://imo2023.jp/en/),
  * Norway was the host for [IMO2022](https://www.imo2022.org/),
  * Russian Federation was the host for [IMO2020](https://imo2020.ru/), IMO2021.

* IMO is held over two consecutive days with 3 problems each. Each day, the contestants have four-and-a-half hours to solve three problems. Each problem is worth 7 points for a maximum total score of 42 points.
* The problems are arranged so that the order in increasing difficulty is Q1, Q4, Q2, Q5, Q3 and Q6, where the Day 1 problems Q1, Q2, and Q3 are in increasing difficulty, and the Day 2 problems Q4, Q5, and Q6 are in increasing difficulty.
