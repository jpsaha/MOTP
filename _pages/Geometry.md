## These notes may be useful

- to the students who would like to have a look at some of the past RMO problem before getting started, 
or just curious about it. 

- as a reference, to anyone who would like to provide guidance to students, 
and is eager to do so as soon as having 
the relevant questions across the topics and sub-topics
available in an organized form.
